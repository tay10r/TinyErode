TinyErode
=========

This is a single-header, multithreaded C++ library for simulating the effect of hydraulic erosion on
height maps. The algorithm is based on the [the one in this paper](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00402079/).

The library takes an arbitrary terrain model and simulated the flow of water across it. As water flows,
soil is picked up from the terrain and deposited in other areas depending on the flow of water.

For example, given the following model of a hill:

When the library simulates erosion, the soil transporation causes the model to change into this:

It can also smooth out noisy terrains, such as this one:

The result:

### Getting Started

See [the example](https://github.com/tay10r/TinyErode/tree/main/docs) to learn how to integrate the library in an application.
